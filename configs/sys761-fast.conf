# Configuration for System 7.6.1 - Fast Storage (writeback cache)
#
# PURPOSE: Optimized for performance with faster storage access for Mac OS 7.6.1
# 
# KEY FEATURES:
# - Writeback cache mode: Writes are cached in memory for speed, then written to disk later
# - Best performance for disk operations (copying files, launching apps, etc.)
# - 256MB RAM for excellent Mac OS 7.6.1 application performance
# - Small risk of data loss if QEMU crashes before cache is flushed
# - Ideal for development, testing, and intensive Mac OS 7.6.1 use
# 
# WHEN TO USE:
# - You want the fastest possible disk performance in Mac OS 7.6.1
# - You're comfortable with minimal data loss risk
# - You frequently install software or work with large files
# - You save your work regularly as a precaution
