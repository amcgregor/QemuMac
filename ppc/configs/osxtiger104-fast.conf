# Configuration for Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger on PowerPC with Fast Performance Settings
#
# PURPOSE: Performance-optimized configuration for Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger PowerPC emulation
# 
# KEY FEATURES:
# - Writeback cache (faster performance, less safety)
# - 1024MB RAM optimized for Mac OS X Tiger
# - Native AIO for better I/O performance
# - USB support enabled
# - Performance-focused settings
# 
# WHEN TO USE:
# - You want maximum performance for Mac OS X Tiger
# - You have fast storage (SSD recommended)
# - You're willing to accept slightly higher risk for better speed
# - You need the best GUI performance and responsiveness
# 
# NOTE: Uses writeback caching - ensure clean VM shutdowns
