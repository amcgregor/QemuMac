## Development History Context

This project represents a significant evolution from simple Mac emulation scripts to a comprehensive dual-architecture emulation platform. The current state reflects months of development focused on:

1. **Architecture Unification**: Creating a single interface that seamlessly handles both 68k and PowerPC emulation
2. **Performance Engineering**: Extensive optimization work for both instruction translation and storage I/O
3. **User Experience**: Comprehensive error handling, automatic dependency detection, and intuitive configuration
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensuring the system works reliably across Linux, macOS, and Windows
5. **Documentation Excellence**: Creating maintainable, comprehensive documentation for long-term project sustainability

The codebase demonstrates advanced shell scripting techniques including:
- Secure array handling for command construction
- Comprehensive error handling with context preservation
- Modular design with shared utility libraries
- Platform-specific feature detection and adaptation
- Network infrastructure management with automatic cleanup
