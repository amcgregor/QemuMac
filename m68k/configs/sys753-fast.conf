# Configuration for System 7.5.3 - Fast Storage (writeback cache)
#
# PURPOSE: Optimized for performance with faster storage access
# 
# KEY FEATURES:
# - Writeback cache mode: Writes are cached in memory for speed, then written to disk later
# - Best performance for disk operations (copying files, launching apps, etc.)
# - Small risk of data loss if QEMU crashes before cache is flushed
# - Ideal for: Development, testing, general use where speed matters more than absolute safety
# 
# WHEN TO USE:
# - You want the fastest possible disk performance
# - You're comfortable with minimal data loss risk
# - You frequently copy large files or install software
# - You save your work regularly as a precaution
