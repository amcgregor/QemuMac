# Configuration for System 7.6.1 - Authentic Hardware Experience
#
# PURPOSE: Historically accurate Mac hardware emulation with period-correct components
# 
# KEY FEATURES:
# - NuBus framebuffer: Emulates actual NuBus graphics cards used in Quadra systems
# - Authentic hardware behavior: Slower but true-to-original Mac experience
# - Historical accuracy: Uses same components and behavior as real Quadra 800
# - 256MB RAM: Maximum memory configuration for premium Mac OS 7.6.1 experience
# - Educational value: Experience Mac OS 7.6.1 exactly as it was on original hardware
# - Testing platform: Ideal for software that specifically targets NuBus graphics
# 
# WHEN TO USE:
# - You want the most historically accurate Mac OS 7.6.1 experience
# - You're testing vintage Mac software that uses NuBus-specific features
# - You're recreating a period-correct high-end Quadra 800 setup
# - You're studying or demonstrating how classic Macs actually behaved
# - Educational or museum-quality emulation is your goal
# - You're running memory-intensive Mac OS 7.6.1 applications authentically
# 
# PERFORMANCE NOTE: NuBus emulation adds overhead compared to built-in graphics.
# For maximum speed, use other configurations with built-in display device.
